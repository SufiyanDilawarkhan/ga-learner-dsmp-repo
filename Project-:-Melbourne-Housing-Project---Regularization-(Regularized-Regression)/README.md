### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement**

Our friend from Iowa, whose housing problem we solved, is now moving to Melbourne for a new assignment Down Under. As we had solved his Iowa housing problem so well, he wants us to solve his Melbourne housing problem too. Armed with our new-found expertise in regularization, we work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc.

The dataset has details of 6830 house entries with the following 16 features:

- Feature	- Description
- Rooms	- Number of rooms
- Type	- Property type
- Price	- Price in dollars
- Method	- Property status
- SellerG	- Real Estate Agent
- Distance	- Distance from CBD
- Postcode	- Code of the area
- Bathroom	- Number of Bathrooms
- Car	- Number of carspots
- Landsize	- Land Size
- BuildingArea	- Building Size
- YearBuilt	- The year in which home was built
- CouncilArea	- Governing council for the area
- Longtitude	- The angular distance of a place east or west
- Regionname	- General Region (West, North West, North, Northeast â€¦etc)
- PropertyCount	- Number of properties that exist in the suburb


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I now have a better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project, I have applied the following concepts.

- Train-Test Split
- Correlation between the features
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regressor
- Lasso Regressor
- Ridge Regressor
- R^2 (R Squared) Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - Data Loading and Splitting in to Train and Test sets.
- Prediction Using Linear Regression
- Prediction Using Lasso Regression
- Prediction Using Ridge Regression
- Prediction Using Cross-Validation
- Prediction Using Polynomial Regressor to improve R^2 (R Squared) value.
