### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement**

We are given references to news pages collected from an web aggregator in the period from 10-March-2014 to 10-August-2014. The resources are grouped into categories that represent pages discussing the same story. News categories included in this dataset include business(b); science and technology(t); entertainment(e); and health(h).

The goal is to predict which class a particular resource belongs to given the title of the resource.


**About the dataset**

This dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. In total there are 422937 resources available in the dataset. The columns included in this dataset are:

- ID: the numeric ID of the article
- TITLE: the headline of the article
- URL: the URL of the article
- PUBLISHER: the publisher of the article
- CATEGORY: the category of the news item; one of: b:business, t:science and technology, e: entertainment and m:health
- STORY: alphanumeric ID of the news story that the article discusses
- HOSTNAME: hostname where the article was posted
- TIMESTAMP: approximate timestamp of the article's publication, given in Unix time (seconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970)


### Learnings from the project

 Doing this project helped me reinforce the following concepts of Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP):

- Preprocess text data with tokenization, stopword removal etc
- Vectorize data using Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches
- Apply classifiers (Logistic and Multinomial Naive Bayes) to perform multi-class classification
