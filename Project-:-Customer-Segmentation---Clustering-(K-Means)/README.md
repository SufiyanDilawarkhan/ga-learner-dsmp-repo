### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement**

Customer segmentation lies at the heart of every consumer facing business nowadays which involves being able to identify different types of customers and then figuring out ways to find more of those individuals so you canâ€¦ you guessed it, get more customers!

In this assessment, I was able to do exactly that, albeit with the help of K-Means clustering and observed how we can form groups of customers exhibiting similar behaviour.


**About the dataset**

I had a dataset consisting of two sheets, with names Offer Information and Transactions. Offer Information had 32 rows and 7 columns while Transactions had 324 rows and 3 columns

**Offer Information Sheet**
Feature description is given below:

- Feature	                - Description
- Offer #	                        - Order ID
- Campaign	                - Month of the campaign
- Varietal	                - Grape variety
- Minimum Qty(kg)	- Minimum quantity ordered in kgs
- Discount(%)	        - Discount on that order
- Origin	                        - Country where the variety of grape is grown
- Past Peak	                - If wine flavor has faded

**Transactions Sheet**
Feature description is given below:

- Feature	                 - Description
- Customer Last Name - Name of the customer purchasing
- Offer #	                         - Order ID
