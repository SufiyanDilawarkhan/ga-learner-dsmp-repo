### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement**

In this project, we predicted the Insurance claim using logistic regression. 
This dataset contains information on the insurance claim. 
Each observation is a different policyholder with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

The dataset has details of 1338 Insurance claim with the following 8 features:

- Feature	- Description
- age	- age of policyholder
- sex	- male(1)/female(0)
- bmi	- body mass index(kg /mÂ²)
- children	- number of children/dependents of policyholder
- smoker	- smoking state nonsmoker(0)/smoker(1)
- region	- residential area northeast(0)/northwest(1)/southeast(2)/southwest(3)
- charges	- medical cost
- insuranceclaim	- yes(1)/no(0)


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better understanding of how to build a logistic regression model. In this project, I applied the following concepts.

- Train-Test Split
- Correlation between the features
- Logistic Regression
- Auc score
- Roc AUC plot
