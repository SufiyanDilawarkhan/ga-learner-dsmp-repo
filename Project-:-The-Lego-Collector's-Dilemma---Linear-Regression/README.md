### Project Overview

 **Problem statement**

I am a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as I can. But before that I wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that I can budget it from my revenue. Since (luckily!), I am a data scientist, I wished to solve this problem myself. 
This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. My aim was to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.

The dataset has details of 12261 lego sets with the following 10 features:

- Feature	- Description
- age	- Which age categories it belongs to
- list_price	- Price of the set (in $)
- num_reviews 	- Number of reviews per set
- piece_count	- Number of pieces in that lego set
- playstarrating	- Ratings
- review_difficulty	- Difficulty level of the set
- star_rating	- Ratings
- theme_name 	- Which theme it belongs
- valstarrating	- Ratings
- country	- Country name


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, I have applied the following concepts.

- Train-Test Split
- Correlation between the features
- Linear Regression
- MSE and R^2 (R Squared) Evaluation Metrics
